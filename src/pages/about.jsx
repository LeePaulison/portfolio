      <p className='mb-4'>
        Buzzwords, acronyms, and jargon—they describe what I do, but they don’t capture who I am. I believe in simplicity, both in life and in design. I’m someone who enjoys clean lines, straightforward solutions, and the occasional deep dive into music. As a self-professed audiophile with a limited budget, I know how to appreciate the beauty of something well-crafted. When I’m not designing, I’m gaming or hanging out with my four cats and dog, and spending time with the woman who makes my life whole. These are the parts of my life that ground me.

        But perhaps none of this helps you decide if I’m the right person for your project—or maybe it does. One aspect of my life that shapes everything I do is that I’m a quadriplegic. I have limited mobility in my hands and no sensation from the chest down. Some might view this as a challenge, but for me, it's a source of strength. My perspective allows me to see technology and design from a unique angle—one where accessibility isn’t just an afterthought but a core principle of the user experience. I believe that great design is inclusive design, and I approach every project with that in mind.

        So, how did I get here? I graduated from Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida in January 2020 with a degree in Simulations and Visualizations—essentially, I’ve been working with immersive technologies and virtual reality since the start. In January 2021, I joined Potawatomi Training, LLC as a Media Developer and transitioned into a Frontend Developer role. My first real dive into HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript came through this role, where I was fortunate enough to learn on the job. I worked with a talented team to develop two e-learning platforms for U.S. government entities. The first focused on language acquisition, while the second dealt with military provisioning. These projects were not just websites—they were interactive learning environments where user engagement and accessibility were key.

        Most recently, I worked with Advanced Automation Corporation, where I was part of a team developing an e-learning course for another government entity. The course was built in ReactJS, a framework I quickly adapted to. I’ve always thrived on learning as I go, and this project allowed me to deepen my expertise in ReactJS while delivering a highly functional and accessible platform. Two of my favorite features were the Flash Card tool—where learners could customize content to suit their study needs—and a media player designed with performance and usability in mind. It included Focus Points and Knowledge Checks, both of which were key to enhancing user engagement.

        Now, I’m looking for my next opportunity to apply what I’ve learned and continue growing as a developer. My commitment to accessibility and creating user-centered designs remains at the heart of everything I do. If you’re looking for a developer who’s ready to bring fresh ideas, a commitment to accessibility, and thoughtful solutions, let’s connect.
